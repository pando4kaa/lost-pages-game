  dialogueLines:
  - Halt! Who goes there? Trespassing near the Whisperwood border?
  - "Oh, it\u2019s just you. Didn't recognize you for a moment. I am Andrew Smooth,
    guardian of this forest edge."
  - Planning to head into the woods, are you? Be on your guard. It's beautiful, but
    treacherous.
  - My main concern these days are the Hollow Slimes. Vile things, always trying
    to ooze past the border towards the village.
  - They seem drawn to... well, never mind. Just keep sharp eyes out. Anything I
    can tell you before you go?
  - The Hollow Slimes? They look... vacant, shimmering but almost see-through. They
    absorb the vitality from the ground, plants... anything organic, really. Don't
    let them touch you.
  - It's my sworn duty to prevent them from reaching the village hearth. A single
    one could cause untold trouble. Stay vigilant out there!
  - The Whisperwood? It's as old as the mountains, full of paths that twist and turn,
    leading to places forgotten by time. Some flora here glows faintly in the twilight.
  - Very well. Keep your wits about you, and don't hesitate to retreat if things
    get dicey. Good luck.
  - 'Good luck, and remember: the forest is beautiful, but it can also be dangerous.'
